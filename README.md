_[Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) - create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo_  

# Deep Learning Project - Dog Breed Identification
***
> This is a dog breed identification project from Kaggle.
> To build a deep neural network which can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of puppy is that?

### Data Description

> Datasets include a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal of this project is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo. Some example in the list of breeds is as follows:

* affenpinscher
* afghan_hound
* african_hunting_dog
* airedale
* american_staffordshire_terrier
* appenzeller
* australian_terrier
* basenji
* basset
* beagle
* bedlington_terrier
* bernese_mountain_dog
……

### Data Overview  

> Total 690MB
* File 1 - train.zip - the training set, image file, provided the breed for these dogs
* File 2 - test.zip - the test set, image file, predict the probability of each breed for each image
* File 3 - labels.csv - csv file with two columns: id and breed, the breeds for the images in the train set
